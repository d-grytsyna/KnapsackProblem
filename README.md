<h1>Knapsack problem</h1> 
Capacity P=200, 100 items, value of items
from 2 to 20 (random), weight from 1 to 10 (random), genetic
algorithm (initial population of 100 people each with 1 different item,
two-point crossover operator of equal genes, mutation with
mutation with a probability of 10%, change only 1 random gene). Developed my own local improvement operator.
